P#
====================
A language and toolkit for **building**, **analyzing**, **systematically testing** and **debugging** asynchronous reactive software, such as web-services and distributed systems.

## Features
The P# framework provides:
- Language extensions to C# for building **event-driven asynchronous** applications, writing **test harnesses**, and specifying **safety** and **liveness properties**.
- A **systematic testing engine** that can capture and control all specified nondeterminism in the system, systematically explore the actual executable code to discover bugs, and report bug traces. A P# bug trace provides a global order of all communication events, and thus is easier to debug.
- Support for **replaying** bug traces, and **debugging** them using the Visual Studio debugger.

## Getting started
The best way to build and start using P# is to read our [wiki](https://github.com/p-org/PSharp/wiki).
