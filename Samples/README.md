P# Samples
====================
A collection of samples that show how to use the P# framework to build or systematically test asynchronous, event-driven applications.

## Where to start
If you are new to P#, please check out the **PSharpAsLibrary** or **PSharpAsLanguage** samples.

You can probably start with the basic [PingPong](https://github.com/p-org/PSharp/tree/master/Samples/PSharpAsLibrary/PingPong) application, which is written using P# as a C# library. If you are feeling a bit adventurous, you might want to try the [PingPong](https://github.com/p-org/PSharp/tree/master/Samples/PSharpAsLanguage/PingPong) application, written in the high-level syntax of P#.

If you have any questions, please get in touch!

## Sample categories
- **PSharpAsLibrary**, which includes sample applications created using P# as a C# library.
- **PSharpAsLanguage**, which includes sample applications created using the high-level syntax of P#.
- **Umanaged**, which includes samples of using P# to systematically test unmanaged applications written in C++.
- **Experimental**, which contain experimental features of P#, primarily to be used by the P# dev team.
