// This sample outlines a generic way of implementing a Receive statement
// that does not block its calling thread: it is called ReceiveAsync in the
// code below. The only restriction is that ReceiveAsync must be the last
// statement of its calling action. ReceiveAsync takes a delegate that is
// called after the receive is successful.

namespace AsyncReceive
{
    // The program has two event types: E1 and E2, each carrying an "int" payload.

    class E1 : Event
    {
        public int x;
        public E1(int x)
        {
            this.x = x;
        }
    }

    class E2 : Event
    {
        public int x;
        public E2(int x)
        {
            this.x = x;
        }
    }

    // Special events that need to be created for each event type
    // on which a Receive has to be done.
    class ReceiveE1Event : Event { }
    class ReceiveE2Event : Event { }

    // The purpose of this machine is to receive three events, of type E1, E2 and E1, respectively
    // and compute and display the sum of their payload. Using a blocking receive, this would be done
    // as:
    // var e1 = Receive(typeof(E1));
    // var e2 = Receive(typeof(E2));
    // var e3 = Receive(typeof(E1));
    // print e1.x + e2.x + e3.x;
    // 
    // But, it is instead done using ReceiveAsync in the method InitAction below.
